# OOODEV-XML

This project adds extra XML support for [OOO Development Tools].

This project uses [lxml]. Even though [lxml] is mature it compiles binaries.
For this reason this XML support project is separate of the main project.

[OOO Development Tools]: https://python-ooo-dev-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

[lxml]: https://pypi.org/project/lxml/
